# ZEOS Orchard Library
The ZEOS Orchard Library is a fork of the Zcash Orchard Library. It is a Rust implementation encapsulating the entire application logic required in order to create private transactions according to the [ZEOS Orchard Shielded Protocol](../protocol.md). At its core is the implementation of the [ZEOS Action Circuit](../protocol/circuit/zeos-circuit.md) from which proving and verifying keys are derived. The proving key is required by client applications to create zero knowledge proofs for private transactions while the verifying key is required by the ZEOS smart contract in order to verify zero knowledge proofs of private transactions. In addition to all the logic related to zk-SNARKs it provides functions to scan the global UTXO state of the ZEOS smart contract and synchronize client applications local state. In contrast to the original Zcash library the ZEOS Orchard library is build to be used in Javascript browser applications compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
